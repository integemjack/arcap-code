INTEGEM SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE LICENSE TERMS
Last updated January 2018

Integem iPlayer 
IF YOU LIVE IN (OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 10. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.
Thank you for choosing Integem!
Depending on how you obtained the iPlayer software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you and Integem (or, based on where you live or if a business where your principal place of business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Integem is the device manufacturer for devices produced by Integem or one of its affiliates, and Integem is the retailer if you acquired the software directly from Integem.
This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which you may use the iPlayer software. You should review the entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that accompany the software and any linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to you. 
By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of these terms, and consent to the transmission of certain information during activation and during your use of the software. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the software or its features. You may contact Integem directly, to determine the return policy and return the software or device for a refund or credit under that policy. You must comply with that policy, which might require you to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund or credit, if any.
1.	Overview.
a.	Applicability. This agreement applies to the iPlayer software that is preinstalled on your device, or acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the media on which you received the software (if any), any fonts, icons, images or sound files included with the software, and also any Integem updates, upgrades, supplements or services for the software, unless other terms come with them. It also applies to iPlayer apps developed by Integem that provide functionality and are a part of iPlayer. If this agreement contains terms regarding a feature or service not available on your device, then those terms do not apply.
b.	Additional terms. Additional Integem and third party terms may apply to your use of certain features, services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it. Please be sure to read them.
(i)	Some iPlayer apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Integem Services Agreement. You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms of use or the app’s settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.
(ii)	Integem, the manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be subject to separate license terms and privacy policies.
 (v)	To the extent included with iPlayer is licensed for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you have commercial use rights under a separate agreement.
2.	Installation and Use Rights.
a.	Software as a Service License. The software is a service, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Integem or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a license to use the software.
b.	Device. In this agreement, “device” means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a device.
c.	Restrictions. The manufacturer or installer and Integem reserve all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. For example, this license does not give you any right to, and you may not:
(i)	use or virtualize features of the software separately;
(ii)	publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the software;
(iii)	transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);
(iv)	work around any technical restrictions or limitations in the software;
(v)	use the software as server software, for commercial hosting, make the software available for simultaneous use by multiple users over a network, install the software on a server and allow users to access it remotely, or install the software on a device for use only by remote users;
(vi)	reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent that the foregoing restriction is (a) permitted by applicable law; (b) permitted by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the software; or (c) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with and linked to by the software; and
(vii)	when using Internet-based features you may not use those features in any way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to try to gain access to or use any service, data, account, or network, in an unauthorized manner.
d.	Multi use scenarios.
(i)	Multiple or pooled connections. Hardware or software you use to multiplex or pool connections, or reduce the number of devices or users that access or use the software, does not reduce the number of licenses you need. You may only use such hardware or software if you have a license for each instance of the software you are using.
(ii)	Use in a virtualized environment. This license allows you to install only one instance of the software for use on one device, whether that device is physical or virtual. If you want to use the software on more than one virtual device, you must obtain a separate license for each instance.
(iii)	Remote access. No more than once every 90 days, you may designate a single user who physically uses the licensed device as the licensed user. The licensed user may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies. Other users, at different times, may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies, but only on devices separately licensed to run the same or higher edition of this software.
(iv)	Remote assistance. You may use remote assistance technologies to share an active session without obtaining any additional licenses for the software. Remote assistance allows one user to connect directly to another user’s computer, usually to correct problems.
3.	Privacy; Consent to Use of Data. Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or receive information when using those features. Many of these features can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Integem may collect, use, and disclose the information and as may be described in the user interface associated with the software features.
4.	Transfer. 
a.	Software preinstalled on device. If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic iPlayer label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.
b.	Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.
5.	Authorized Software and Activation. You are authorized to use this software only if you are properly licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine product key or by other authorized method. Updates, support, and other services might only be offered to users of genuine Integem software.
6.	Updates. The software periodically checks for system and app updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Integem or authorized sources, and Integem may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.
7.	Geographic and Export Restrictions. If your software is restricted for use in a particular geographic region, then you may activate the software only in that region. You must also comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on geographic and export restrictions please contact Integem
8.	Support and Refund Procedures.
a.	For software preinstalled on a device. For the software generally, contact the device manufacturer or installer for support options. Refer to the support number provided with the software. For updates and supplements obtained directly from Integem, Integem may provide limited support services for properly licensed software. If you are seeking a refund, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its refund policies. You must comply with those policies, which might require you to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund.
b.	For software acquired from a retailer. Integem provides limited support services for properly licensed software. If you purchased the software from a retailer and are seeking a refund, and you cannot obtain one where you acquired the software, contact Integem for information
9.	Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if You Live in (or if a Business Your Principal Place of Business is in) the United States.
We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. “We,” “our,” and “us” includes Integem, the device manufacturer, and software installer.
a.	Disputes covered—everything except IP. The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and the manufacturer or installer, or you and Integem, concerning the software, its price, or this agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.
b.	Mail a Notice of Dispute first. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Integem Inc., ATTN: LEGAL, Integem Inc., P.O.Box 2526, Cupertino, CA 95015, USA. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.
c.	Arbitration procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. To start an arbitration, submit documentation to the AAA; mail a copy to Integem. Any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in our principal place of business—Cupertino, California if your dispute is with Integem. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
d.	Arbitration fees and payments.
(i)	Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
(ii)	Disputes involving any amount. If you start an arbitration we won’t seek our AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees we reimbursed, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. 
e.	Must file within one year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes — see Section 10.a.) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.
f.	Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 10 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 10 still applies.
g.	Conflict with AAA rules. This agreement governs if it conflicts with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.
10.	Governing Law. The laws of the state of California, USA govern all claims and disputes concerning the software, its price, or this agreement, including breach of contract claims and claims under consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for unjust enrichment, and in tort, regardless of conflict of law principles. 
11.	Additional Notices.
a.	Networks, data and Internet usage. Some features of the software and services accessed through the software may require your device to access the Internet. Your access and usage (including charges) may be subject to the terms of your cellular or internet provider agreement. Certain features of the software may help you access the Internet more efficiently, but the software’s usage calculations may be different from your service provider’s measurements. You are always responsible for (i) understanding and complying with the terms of your own plans and agreements, and (ii) any issues arising from using or accessing networks, including public/open networks. You may use the software to connect to networks, and to share access information about those networks, only if you have permission to do so.
b.	Limited rights versions. If the software version you acquired is marked or otherwise intended for a specific or limited use, then you may only use it as specified. You may not use such versions of the software for commercial, non-profit, or revenue-generating activities.
(i)	Evaluation. For evaluation (or test or demonstration) use, you may not sell the software, use it in a live operating environment, or use it after the evaluation period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, evaluation software is provided “AS IS” and no warranty, implied or express (including the Limited Warranty), applies to these versions.
(ii)	NFR. You may not sell software marked as “NFR” or “Not for Resale”.
(iii)	Preview. You may choose to use preview, insider, beta or other pre-release versions of the software (“previews”) that Integem may make available. You may use previews only up to the software’s expiration date and so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, previews are provided “AS IS,” and no warranty, implied or express (including the Limited Warranty), applies to these versions. By installing previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from the manufacturer of your device or network operator, if applicable. Integem is not responsible for any damage thereby caused to you. Integem may not provide support services for previews. If you provide Integem comments, suggestions or other feedback about the preview (“submission”), you grant Integem and its partners rights to use the submission in any way and for any purpose.
12.	Entire Agreement. 
This agreement (together with the printed paper license terms or other terms accompanying any software supplements, updates, and services that are provided by Integem, and that you use), and the terms contained in web links listed in this agreement, are the entire agreement for the software and any such supplements, updates, and services (unless Integem provides other terms with such supplements, updates, or services). You can review this agreement after your software is running by going to About within the software. You can also review the terms by requesting a copy of this Agreement from Integem.

***********************************************************************
LIMITED WARRANTY
Integem warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Integem materials that accompany the software. If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Integem during the 90-day term of this limited warranty, Integem provides this limited warranty for them. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond the reasonable control of Integem. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software and lasts for 90 days. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from Integem during that 90-day period are also covered, but only for the remainder of that 90-day period or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.
Integem give no other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. Integem exclude all implied warranties and conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your local law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, then any implied warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law requires a longer limited warranty term, despite this agreement, then that longer term will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement allows.
If Integem breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either: (i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the software (or at its election the device on which the software was preinstalled) for a refund of the amount paid, if any. The Integem may also repair or replace supplements, updates, and replacement of the software or provide a refund of the amount you paid for them, if any. These are your only remedies for breach of warranty. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.
Except for any repair, replacement, or refund Integem, may provide, you may not under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or under any theory recover any damages or other remedy, including lost profits or direct, consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if Integem, knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to recover damages from Integem, even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the software (or up to $50 USD if you acquired the software for no charge).
WARRANTY PROCEDURES
For service or refund, you must provide your proof of purchase and comply with Integem’s return policies, which might require you to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed; the certificate of authenticity label including the product key (if provided with your device) must remain affixed.

THESE ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF A WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR CONDITION YOUR LOCAL LAWS IMPOSE.
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY YOUR LOCAL LAWS, IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM INTEGEM ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE (OR UP TO $50 USD IF YOU ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FOR NO CHARGE). YOU WILL NOT, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO, SEEK TO RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR REMEDY, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS AND DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, UNDER ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER ANY THEORY.

THE DAMAGE EXCLUSIONS AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT APPLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO REMEDY (THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS”), IF REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR A REFUND (IF REQUIRED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW) DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES, IF INTEGEM KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES, OR IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
